# Changelog

## [v3.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/elixir-nebulex/nebulex_local/tree/v3.0.0-rc.2) (2025-10-06)
> [Full Changelog](https://github.com/elixir-nebulex/nebulex_local/compare/v3.0.0-rc.1...v3.0.0-rc.2)

### Enhancements

- [Nebulex.Adapters.Local] Improved generation garbage collection performance by
  deleting ETS tables directly instead of flushing all objects first. This
  change significantly improves GC performance for large caches, reducing
  generation deletion from O(n) to O(1) complexity. The deprecated generation
  is now deleted after a grace period defined by the new `:gc_cleanup_delay`
  option (formerly `:gc_flush_delay`), which allows ongoing operations to
  complete safely before table removal.
  [#2](https://github.com/elixir-nebulex/nebulex_local/issues/2).
- [Nebulex.Adapters.Local] Added automatic retry logic to handle race conditions
  when accessing deleted generations during garbage collection. Operations now
  retry up to 3 times when encountering `ArgumentError` due to deleted ETS
  tables, automatically fetching fresh generation references. This prevents
  crashes and improves resilience during GC cycles, especially under high
  concurrency.
  [#3](https://github.com/elixir-nebulex/nebulex_local/issues/3).
- [Nebulex.Adapters.Local] Added support for entry tagging via the `:tag` option.
  Cache entries can now be tagged with arbitrary terms (atoms, tuples, strings,
  etc.) to enable logical grouping, selective invalidation, and efficient
  filtering using ETS match specifications. This feature is particularly useful
  for organizing related entries (e.g., user sessions, feature groups) and
  performing bulk operations on tagged subsets of the cache. Tags can be
  specified when using `put/3`, `put_all/2`, and related operations, and entries
  can be queried by tag using match specs.
  [#4](https://github.com/elixir-nebulex/nebulex_local/issues/4).
- [Nebulex.Adapters.Local] Added `Nebulex.Adapters.Local.QueryHelper` module
  providing a user-friendly, SQL-like syntax for building ETS match
  specifications. Instead of requiring users to know the internal entry tuple
  structure `{:entry, key, value, touched, exp, tag}`, QueryHelper offers named
  field bindings (`:key`, `:value`, `:tag`, `:touched`, `:exp`) with a
  declarative syntax. The `:select` clause is optional and defaults to `true`,
  making count and delete operations more concise. This dramatically improves
  the developer experience when working with the queryable API, especially for
  tag-based queries. Example: `match_spec value: v, tag: t, where: t == :group_a, select: v`.
  [#5](https://github.com/elixir-nebulex/nebulex_local/issues/5).

### Backwards incompatible changes

- [Nebulex.Adapters.Local] Renamed `:gc_flush_delay` option to
  `:gc_cleanup_delay` to better reflect its purpose. The option now controls
  the delay before the deprecated generation is deleted (not just flushed).
  Please update your configuration accordingly.

## [v3.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/elixir-nebulex/nebulex_local/tree/v3.0.0-rc.1) (2025-05-01)
> [Full Changelog](https://github.com/elixir-nebulex/nebulex_local/compare/b7b9c8924f0c4cbfa37c84bdbc152b23aaed067c...v3.0.0-rc.1)

### Enhancements

- [Nebulex.Adapters.Local] Added `:gc_memory_check_interval` option to run size
  and memory checks. The option receives a positive integer with the time in
  milliseconds or an anonymous function to get the timeout at runtime.

### Backwards incompatible changes

- [Nebulex.Adapters.Local] Removed `:gc_cleanup_min_timeout` option.
  Please use `:gc_memory_check_interval` instead.
- [Nebulex.Adapters.Local] Removed `:gc_cleanup_max_timeout` option.
  Please use `:gc_memory_check_interval` instead.

### Closed issues

- Migrate local adapter to Nebulex v3
